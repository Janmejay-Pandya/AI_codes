Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data. The core of machine learning is pattern recognition. Data scientists use algorithms to train models on large datasets. These models can then make predictions on new, unseen data. One of the most common types of machine learning is supervised learning. In supervised learning, the model is trained using labeled data. The goal is to find patterns that map input features to target labels. Another common approach is unsupervised learning, which is used when the data is unlabeled. Unsupervised learning is typically used to identify hidden structures in data, such as clustering similar data points. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that focuses on learning from feedback in the form of rewards or punishments. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, involves using neural networks with many layers. These networks can automatically learn hierarchical features from raw data.
