Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP involves the development of algorithms that allow machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. One of the most important tasks in NLP is text classification, where the goal is to categorize text into predefined categories. Text classification is commonly used in spam email detection and sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis helps businesses understand customer opinions by analyzing reviews and social media posts. Named entity recognition (NER) is another important task in NLP, where the goal is to identify and classify named entities such as people, organizations, and locations. Machine translation is another area of NLP that focuses on automatically translating text from one language to another. NLP is also used in chatbots, which can interact with users and provide answers to their questions.
