Honestly, I had high expectations from this movie but was a little disappointed. The performances were solid, but the script felt weak and predictable at times. The first half was slow and dragged on, making it hard to stay engaged. However, the cinematography was amazing, and the visuals were stunning. The action scenes were well choreographed and thrilling to watch. The background score was good but could have been more impactful during key moments. Some supporting characters felt underdeveloped and unnecessary. The climax was decent but lacked the emotional punch it was aiming for. Overall, it's an average film with some great moments. Watch it for the action and visuals, but don't expect a deep, thought-provoking story. I might watch it again just for the brilliant fight scenes and camera work. It had potential, but the execution fell short.
