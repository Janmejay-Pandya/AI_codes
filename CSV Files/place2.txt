The Taj Mahal is a stunning white marble mausoleum located in Agra, India. It was commissioned by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Construction began in 1632 and took about 22 years to complete. Over 20,000 artisans worked on the project. The Taj Mahal is considered one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture. It combines elements of Islamic, Persian, and Indian styles. The structure is surrounded by beautiful gardens, fountains, and pools. At sunrise, the Taj Mahal glows pink, while at sunset, it appears golden. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of visitors each year. The main dome is 73 meters high and surrounded by four minarets. Inside, there are intricate carvings and semi-precious stone inlays. The symmetry of the Taj Mahal is a remarkable feature. The reflection of the monument in the water channels creates a mesmerizing view. Security measures are tight, and visitors must pass through screenings. Footwear must be removed or covered before entering. Photography is allowed in most areas but restricted inside the main mausoleum. Fridays are reserved for prayer and the site remains closed to tourists. The Taj Mahal represents eternal love and is often referred to as a "teardrop on the cheek of time." Visiting the Taj Mahal is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
